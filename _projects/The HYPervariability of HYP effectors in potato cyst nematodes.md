Plants use a large arsenal of proteins to recognize and prevent pathogens from causing diseases. Any successful pathogen thus has to deploy proteins termed ‘effectors’ to suppress the plant’s defense system.<br/>
This project focused on a highly unusual effector family of potato cyst nematodes called HYPs. HYP effectors consist of a ‘hyper-variable’ middle domain that displays extreme genomic variability in number and organization of subfamily-specific repeats. This domain is flanked by conserved regions that are 95% identical between species and have remained unchanged for ~30 million years. In other words, the repeats in the middle region of the gene are ‘shuffled’ in number and how they are organized while keeping the neighbouring regions conserved. How a genome can permit such a large variation in these genes while still maintaining identity in the conserved regions cannot be explained using currently known genetic mechanisms.<br/>
I used long-read sequencing technologies such as Oxford Nanopore and PacBio-HiFi to unravel the underlying genetics of these distinct genes.
