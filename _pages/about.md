                                                                                    -Harberd,  Nicholas in Seed to Seed: The Secret Life of Plants

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge at [The Department of Plant Sciences](https://www.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/directory/unnati-sonawala)/[Crop Science Centre](https://www.cropsciencecentre.org/staff/unnati-sonawala). 

I study plant-microbe interactions, and am currently working on understanding the genomics of a highly unusual effector family in potato cyst nematodes. To learn more about current and past projects follow here [projects](projects). See [CV](cv) for a summary of my education and career.
