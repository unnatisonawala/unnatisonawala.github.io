This is the first time this has happened to me (but hopefully not the last!) — two research articles published back-to-back within a week!

### 1. Tools for Studying Amino Acid Transport

📄 **[Characterization and whole genome sequencing of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* strains lacking several amino acid transporters: Tools for studying amino acid transport](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315789)**

This side-project from my PhD at Virginia Tech focused on studying plant amino acid transporters. Mutant yeast strains that lack their endogenous transporters serve as a great system for heterologous expression of plant transporters. This paper summarizes our work on characterizing these strains and presents whole-genome sequencing results of the strain 22∆10⍺.

### 2. New Disease Report

📄 **[Report of *Pratylenchus penetrans* on quince (*Cydonia oblonga*) in England](https://doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-02-25-0372-PDN)**

In collaboration with my colleague and friend Victor at the Crop Science Centre, we report the presence of *Pratylenchus penetrans* on quince roots collected in Sheffield, England.
