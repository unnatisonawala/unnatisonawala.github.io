This is the first time that this has happened to me (but hopefully not the last  ) - two research articles coming out back-to-back within a week's time!

1. Tools for studying amino acid transport 

[Characterization and whole genome sequencing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains lacking several amino acid transporters: Tools for studying amino acid transport](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315789)
The first is a that I worked on during my PhD at Virginia Tech, wherein I studied plant amino acid transporters. Mutant yeast strains that lack their endogenous amino acid transporters lend themselves well to studying plant transporters via heterologous expression. This paper summarizes our work on characterizing a few of these srtains and describes the results from whole-genome sequencing of the strain of choice 22∆10⍺.

2. New diesase report

[Report of Pratylenchus penetrans on quince (Cydonia oblonga) in England](https://doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-02-25-0372-PDN)
The second is a collaboration with my colleague (and friend) Victor at the Crop Science Centre, where we report presence of *Pratylenchus penetrans* on quince roots collected in Sheffield, England.
